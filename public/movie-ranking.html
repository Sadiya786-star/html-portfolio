<h1>The Best Movies According to Sadiya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sanam Teri Kasam</h3>
<p>This is bollywwod movie the most romatic movie i have ever watched. The movie was quite flop when it was released in theaters in 2016.
   But now in 2025 it got re-released and i love it.
</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>As all know this hollywood hit is the ultimate love story and romantic movie as well. 
   The fact tht i like this movie is the eternal love between the hero and heroine
</p>
<h3>SitaRamam</h3>
<p>This is a tollywood movie. Again an eternal peice of love sotry , where the hero and heroine get apart.
   Basically the hero is a soilder and he will be prisoned in pakistan jail in one mission . 
   And i love how Rashmika acted.
